# Who am i?
Hi! I am a proactive and detail-oriented first-year Computer Science student specializing in Software Quality Assurance. My goal is to help you ensure your applications are bug-free and provide the best possible user experience through meticulous manual testing and clear bug reporting.

In addition to my focus on QA, I have a strong foundation in logical problem-solving, demonstrated through my experience using Fortran for physics and engineering problem modeling. This background has sharpened my analytical skills and my ability to tackle complex challenges, which I now apply to find even the most hidden bugs in software.

I am a quick learner, highly responsible, and eager to contribute to your project's success.
